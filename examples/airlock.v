(** From now on, we will reason about [tog] using [tog_equ_1] and [tog_equ_2].
    FreeSpec tactics rely heavily on [cbn] to simplify certain terms, so we use
    the <<simpl never>> options of the [Arguments] vernacular command to prevent
    [cbn] from unfolding [tog].

    This pattern is common in FreeSpec.  Later in this example, we will use this
    trick to prevent [cbn] to unfold impure computations covered by intermediary
    theorems. *)

(** The objective of this lemma is to prove that, if either the right door or

    (hpost : post (to_hoare doors_contract p) ω x ω')
  : sel left ω' = false \/ sel right ω' = false.

(** We reason by induction on the impure computation [p]:

    - Either [p] is a local, pure computation; in such a case, the doors state
      does not change, hence the proof is trivial.

    - Or [p] consists in a request to the doors interface, and a continuation
      whose domain satisfies the theorem, i.e. it preserves the invariant that
      either the left or the right door is closed.  Due to this hypothesis, we
      only have to prove that the first request made by [p] does not break the
      invariant. We consider two cases.

      - Either the computation asks for the state of a given door ([IsOpen]),
        then again the doors state does not change and the proof is trivial.
      - Or the computation wants to toggle a door [d].  We know by hypothesis
        that either [d] is closed or [d] is open (thanks to the
        [one_door_safe_all_doors_safe] result and the [safe] hypothesis).
        Again, we consider both cases.

         - If [d] is closed —and therefore will be opened—, then because we
           consider a respectful run, [co d] is necessarily closed too (it is a
           requirements of [door_contract]). Once [d] is opened, [co d] is still
           closed.
         - Otherwise, [co d] is closed, which means once [d] is toggled (no
           matter its initial state), then [co d] is still closed.

         That is, we prove that, when [p] toggles [d], [co d] is necessarily
         closed after the request has been handled.  Because there is at least
         one door closed ([co d]), we can conclude that either the right or the
         left door is closed thanks to [one_door_safe_all_doors_safe]. *)
